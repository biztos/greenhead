The prompt is sent to the first agent; then the first agent's response
becomes the prompt for the second agent.  The second agent's response is
the prompt for the first againt again, and so on.

The conversation will continue until the maximum number of allowed
completions is reached, or an error occurs.

From each agent's point of view, the other agent is the "user".

If the prompt begins with '@' then it will be read from a file, e.g. @foo.txt.

Note that output and limit controls are very important when running pairs:
if --max-completions or --max-toolchain is set to a high number (or zero) the
run can be very costly.  Likewise, if output is not monitored it may be lost.
