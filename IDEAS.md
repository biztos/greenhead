## Ship default implementations of e.g. Claud's BASH support.

This is scary?  Yeah, kinda scary!

Any way to run it safely?

## Broker

A broker could be really cool.

Imagine you set up a chat in which you can answer different people, not only
one chat partner.  Will this work?

And you can direct the conversation.

So you can say: `@bob what's today's color?`  And then Bob might ask Jim for
the data, and Jim calls a function.

We could have a broker sitting in the middle.  Broker knows which Agent is for
which name.

But what happens if multiple Agents are talking to one Agent at the same time?

You'd have to make it turn-based somehow, maybe?

Well anyway -- two is plenty to start.
