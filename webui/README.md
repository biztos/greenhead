# webui -- single-page app for simple chat ui

## UPDATE: oof, this needs a full rewrite, as does the access API it uses. :-(

It *might* work for you, however it should be considered broken at this time.
Stick to the CLI until further notice.

## NOTE: vite-env-d.ts is a special file! without it, imports break!
